## Why Youths Take Drugs

Posted on _July 28th, 2022_ . _**By: Feranmi Ayoola**_.

Reasons youth take drugs cannot be properly accessed without elucidating what Drug is, the Abuse there in and the examples of drugs that are commonly abused.
Therefore, Drug is simple said as any substance used as a medication or in the preparation of medication. According to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Art, Drug is referred to as a substance intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of diseases.

Having stated that, Drug Abuse on the other hand, is the excessive, maladaptive, or addictive use of drugs for non-medical purposes despite social, psychological and physical problems that may arise from such use. Dr Ananya Mandal MD, stated that Drug Abuse or Substance Abuse refers to the use of certain chemicals for the purpose of creating pleasurable effects on the brain. Statistics show over 190million drug users across the globe having Youths as dominant abusers of it. Examples of drugs that are commonly abused are; Alcohol, Tobacco, Cocaine from cocoa, Opium and Opioids from puppy plants, Hashish or Marijuana from Cannabis and Synthetic drugs such as Heroine, Ectasy and LSD to mention a few.

Basically, Reasons for youth high intake of drugs range according to writer’s perspective. As a Youth who has been with Drug Abusers/Addicts, I would list and explain reasons young people find Drugs pleasurable below;

1.  BOREDOM: Is the most common reason that teenagers begin experimenting with drugs and Alcohol in that they are simply bored and have no deeper interests. Try to get them occupied with activities so they don’t have time to think about substance use.

2.  DEPRESSION: Some Youths turn to drugs and alcohol as a form of escapism. They see these substances as a way to forget and feel happier when depressed or sad. Proper attention should be given to sudden change in attitude of Youths.

3.  LOW SELF-ESTEEM: A lot of Youths have seen drugs as Avenue to boost their lost confidence. They are often faced with different stereotypes of attaining certain standard thereby loosing confidence if they fail to meet that said standard and make use of drugs and alcohol to escape this reality.

4.  PEER PRESSURE: The “I gats belong Gang” peer pressure is the major push in the wheel reason a lot of youths now find their self abusing drugs. This is unnecessary burden youth unknowingly mount on themselves because they also want to experience what their addict friend feels too.

Above Reasons are purely written based on my own experience of drug addicts as a Youth. I hope this helps in preventing young minds and also curb adults who are already rooted in the drug Abuse business.

**Thank you for reading**.
