## GIRL CHILD EDUCATION

Posted on _July 28th, 2022_ . **By: AYOOLA SIKIRAT BUSARI**

A girl child is a female offspring. From the age of 0-18 the child is still under adult care, the child still needs guardians from the parents, adults and those who surround her.

From the infant to adolescence stage of development the child needs to be built mentally, psychologically, character and in developing her personality. At this ages, the child is still dependent on others. The child looks at those that surround her, watching their steps. The girl child's physical, mental, emotional development starts to get to the peak at the young adults stage.

Education is the process of acquiring information, an act of receiving knowledge, skills and leads that have been learned either formally or informally. From (0-5years) covers the nursery or early childhood, (6-12) primary level while (12-18) is the secondary level at this stage the child needs proper care and education, adequate attention from the elders.

Female children have access to education not the other way round which their parents married them off at a tender age.

There are so many reasons for girls to be educated. Let take a look at it;

If a girl child is educated, it bring a betterment and healthy future for the generation
 It will help in reducing human trafficking because women are the one being used due to lack of education and poverty but if a girl is educated everything will be resolved.

Safe sex: the girl child will have more knowledge about sex, HIV/AIDS and how to protect her self from unwanted pregnancy which leads most of the girls to early marriage.

There is an adage that says "Educate a man, you educate an individual, but educate a woman, you educate a nation". Girls education goes beyond getting girls into school, they need to ensure the girl feels safe while in school, make sure she has the opportunity to complete the education and also learn skills. Educated women tend to be more informed about nutrition and health care.

Women deserve more than they are being treated, they are able and capable of being president, governor, senator, commissioner and so on. If will look at the global development lately, women have demonstrated their capacity in leadership positions, going by the educational sector also women are helping alot. The female child should get a fair chance, just as the male child is participating in education at any level they want to reach. Not only the male are leaders of tomorrow, if the female child gets a better education we are going to see that they can do better than the male child.
