The distance was 5.5km, around 8 am. The Vice-Chancellor as well as other officials of the University were well presented alongside the students.

It was amazing, tiresome and fun at the same time. The Disc Jockey (DJ) plays music to ginger the morale of the participants, although it was not the first Kwasu Trek with the Vice Chancellor this edition was extraordinary. The trekkers arrived at the Tarmac before the arrival of the cyclists, the cyclists were led by Engineer Gbenga Adebayo Jimba, the Director of Royal Media Group. The Cycling was tagged “Ride for Life” and took off from Ilorin at the University Contact Office down to Malete, the University's Main Campus.

The last bus stop was the school Art Gallery where several pictures were taken.

The Vice-Chancellor Prof. Mustapha Akanbi in his speech stated that the moment is a fantastic one and worth it. He continued in his speech, “let us all imbibe the attitude of trekking and cycling, it’s not just a form of fun but also an avenue to make network, connect with people you meet.” he said.

The ban on tricycle according to him was to save the environment from more health risks.

Both the cyclists and trekkers were given refreshments.
