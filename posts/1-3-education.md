## Effects Of Inclusion On Students With And Without Special Educational Ne Meeds Reviewed.

Posted on _July 28th, 2022_ .

The social networking sites (SNSs) are dedicated websites or applications that allow the clients to communicate with each other for sharing information, posting videos, pictures, comments, and messages.[1] A wide spectrum of telecommunication gadgets are available for networking which are broadly classified in six categories, that is, blogs and microblogs (e.g., Twitter), collaborative projects (e.g., Wikipedia), content communities (e.g., YouTube), virtual social worlds (e.g., Second Life), virtual game worlds (e.g., World of Warcraft), and SNSs such as Facebook and MySpace.[2] Google and Facebook are the most commonly used social media tools, followed by YouTube, Twitter, Flickr, and LinkedIn.[3] The usage of SNSs depends upon specific requirements of the clients. Precisely, if an academician wants to supervise trainees’ use of social media, Facebook, the most popular SNS, would be a logical choice.[4] On the other hand, if a researcher or learner wishes to follow conversations in a particular discipline or contribute by sharing novel research information, one may consider Twitter, a popular microblogging SNS used by 15% of adults.[5] Blogging is recommended for those who wish to further develop their writing skills. Engagement with social media can be personal, professional, or both, and there is ample evidence that digitally-savvy adults and youth use social media for health-related information.[6]Social media uses mobile and web-based technologies to create highly interactive digital platforms through which individuals and communities share, co-create, discuss, and modify their interactions. It facilitates pervasive and profound means of communication organizations, communities, and individuals.[7] For this purpose, “Web 2.0” is often used interchangeably with “Social Media” or “user-generated content.”[8] There is convincing evidence that SNSs are becoming popular among university students, specifically in connection with their studies.[9] There are over 350 such SNSs in operation across the internet,[10] however, there is a paucity of data in the adult literature describing their usage for educational purposes by medical students. This meta-analysis aims to test the hypothesis that “medical students use SNSs for educational purposes.” The results of the meta-analysis are then analyzed and conclusions are drawn to capture future recommendations.

Online social networking sites (SNSs) (e.g., Facebook, MySpace, Flickr, Twitter and YouTube) have emerged as rapidly growing mechanisms to exchange personal and professional information among university students. This research aims to determine the medical students’ extent of usage of SNSs for educational purposes.

#### MATERIALS AND METHODS:

The databases Medline, Educational Resources Information Centre (ERIC), Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Cochrane library, and Excerpta Medica Data Base (EMBASE) were searched for articles about the usage of SNSs by medical students and the extent of usage of SNSs for educational purpose. The search included the period from 1 January 2004 to 1 January 2014. Data was retrieved by connecting Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms [“social media” or “social network” or “social networking” or “medical education” or “medical students” or “Facebook” or “Twitter” or “Web.

#### MATERIALS AND METHODS:

Majority (75%) of the respondents admitted using SNSs, whereas 20% used these sites for sharing academic and educational information. No single study explored the impact of the SNSs on the academic performance.

### CONCLUSION:

Understanding and knowledge of the significant use of SNSs by the medical students demand inclusion of such domains in medical curricula. This will train tomorrow's doctors in fostering their skills of digital technology for educational purposes.
