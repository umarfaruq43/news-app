## Fake Bishops Hired on the Unveil of Kashim Shetima as APC Presidential Running Mate

Posted on _July 28th, 2022_ . _**By: Faith Adelodun**_.

At the official presentation of former Governor of Borno State, Kashim Shettima, as the running mate of the presidential flag bearer of the All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, on Wednesday, journalists watched in amusement as persons dressed as pastors and bishops showed up at the venue.

Their presence seemed to cause a stir as onlookers and guests stared hard at them as they walked into the reception of the Musa Yar’Adua Centre, dressed in their cassocks and habits, amid heavy security at the venue.

Nigerians have reacted to this as knocks have greeted the APC and its flag bearer, Tinubu, on social media.

Popular #EndSARS activist, Rinu Oduala, joined others in reaction on Twitter via her handle, @SavvyRinu, saying, “The APC is fielding a Muslim-Muslim ticket but went to rent fake bishops. What sort of ridicule is this? What message do they think this will send?”

Another tweet, @ejykmykel1, said, “Dear @OfficialAPCNg, We have only four female bishops in Nigeria: Bishop Oluremi, Ayotunde Obembe, Bishop Bola Odeleke, Bishop Peace Okonkwo,  Archbishop Margaret Idahosa.
